Demolicious is a general purpose SIMT inspired computer.
It is specialized to handle parallel rendering of computer graphics.
The performance of the system scales linearly with the amount of cores.

In addition this system is the first of its kind in this project with an HDMI output.
Computer generated graphics was chosen as a showcase application, and was successfully shown on a HDMI enabled screen.

Also this is the first computer to make use of cross clock domain design.

A backup oriented design philosophy for the PCB was chosen as the philoshoply with highest likelyhood of success.
It has been implemented on a PCB, and passed testing and verification.
