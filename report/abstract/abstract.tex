Demolicious is a general purpose SIMT inspired computer.
It is specialized to handle parallel rendering of computer graphics.
The performance of the system scales linearly with the amount of cores.

In addition, this system is the first of its kind in this project with an HDMI output.
Computer generated graphics was chosen as a showcase application,
and was successfully demonstrated on an HDMI enabled screen.

It features a multi-core architecture,
and is designed to maximize processor core utilization by hiding memory latency.

The system has been implemented on a PCB,
using a backup oriented design philosophy, and passed testing and verification.
