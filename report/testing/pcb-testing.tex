\section{PCB tests}

After receiving the finished PCB and the components, we performed the following tests before reaching a final (hardware-wise)functional computer.   

\subsection{Solder, signal and power test}

The purpose of these tests was to solder components and checking that their connections held, as well as checking that power correctly propagated through the board.

\subsection{Oscillator and clock test}

These tests consisted of using an oscilloscope in order to probe the outputs of the FPGA's oscillator and the high frequency and low frequency crystals.
