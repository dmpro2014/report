\section{PCB tests}

After receiving the finished PCB and the components, a series of tests were performed to make sure all parts of assembling the finished computer were done correctly.

\subsection{Solder, signal and power test}

The purpose of these tests was to solder components and check that their connections held, as well as check that power correctly propagated through the board.

\subsection{Oscillator and clock test}

These tests consisted of using an oscilloscope in order to probe the outputs of the FPGA's oscillator and the high frequency and low frequency crystals of the MCU.
