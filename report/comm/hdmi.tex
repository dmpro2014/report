Many logically separate parts of the Design work together to enable the video output.
The part that fetches video-data from the current framebuffer in memory.
The part that buffers the incoming data.
The part that generates the video-timings.
And the part that codes the signal as TDMS.
At that comes the clocking-infrastructure.

Note that everything in the section applies equally to DVI-I as HDMI. HDMI is a superset of DVI-I, and nothing exclusive to HDMI is made use of.
Also, as video-timings of DVI are inherited from VGA, everything except the TDMS-encoder would be useful for VGA-output.
