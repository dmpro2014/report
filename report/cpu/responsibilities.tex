\section{Responsibilites}

The EFM32GG Microcontroller acts as the CPU in the system.
It is connected to every I/O module except for the graphics output from the GPU.
A program which is stored in the flash memory on the CPU will start running when the board is powered up.
Since the microcontroller has a CPU role, parts of the demo (those which are not parallelizable)
will be executing on this component.
In certain areas of the program, it can choose to execute a "kernel", which will run on the GPU.

\subsubsection{Functionality}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Load all kernels into instruction memory on the GPU.
  \item Start executing program.
  \item When a kernel is encountered any parameters are loaded to the constant storage.
  \item Any data which will not fit in constant storage is loaded to memory.
  \item When all data is ready, a kernel start signal is sent.
  \item Upon the completion of a kernel, the fpga sends a signal back to the CPU.
\end{itemize}
