\chapter{CPU}

The main control unit of the Demolicious computer is a single-core CPU.
The parts of an application which are not parallelizable, called the host program, will be executing on this component.
Kernels written for the GPU can be launched by the CPU when requested by the host program.

The CPU is implemented on an EFM32GG Microcontroller.
