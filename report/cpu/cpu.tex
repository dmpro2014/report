\chapter{CPU}

Now that we have seen how to write code that colors the screen with a beautiful green color, 
it is time to see what is actually happening on the Demolicious System during this execution. 

Our journey starts in the main control unit of the Demolicious computer, namely the CPU, which is implemented on an EFM32GG Microcontroller.

This is the component that runs the C code seen in the last chapter, starting the kernel.

\subfile{../cpu/functionality.tex}

\subfile{../cpu/bus.tex}

\subfile{../cpu/load-kernel.tex}

\subfile{../cpu/run-kernel.tex}

\subfile{../cpu/load-constant.tex}

We have now seen how our kernel is bootstrapped and executed. 
The assembled kernel is uploaded to the GPU which is then given a command to run said kernel with one thread per pixel.
