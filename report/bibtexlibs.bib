Copy the shit out of the ones already here and use \cite{...} where ... is the first parameter (i.e. eeds-compendium).

@misc{example,
        author          =   "Cristea",
        title           =   "How to train your goose",
        institution     =   "Pockets",
        howpublished    =   "Pidgeon"
}
