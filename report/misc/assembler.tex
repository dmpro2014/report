\section{Assembler}
\label{sec:assembler}

An assembler is implemented, to be able to run kernels written for Demolicious on the GPU.
The assembler is written in Python.
In addition to supporting assembly of all instructions supported by the GPU,
it provides additional pseudo instructions, as well as aliases for special purpose registers.

The assembler is available on GitHub \url{https://github.com/dmpro2014/simulator/}.

\section{Simulator}
\label{sec:simulator}

In addition to the assembler,
a tool for verifying the correctness of kernels before they are run on the GPU has been developed.
It is based on the same parsing backend as the assembler, and simulates the execution of kernels, instruction for instruction.
When the set of threads have been simulated, a resulting framebuffer is rendered to screen.
This tool has proven itself very useful when developing kernels,
as it reduces the need of re-assembling and uploading kernels to the GPU to verify the correctness of the assembly code.

The simulator is part of the same project as the assembler described in section \ref{sec:assembler}.
