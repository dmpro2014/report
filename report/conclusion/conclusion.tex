\chapter{Conclusion}

We designed and implemented a graphics processing unit inspired system,
capable of executing a large amount of threads fast enough to display graphics to a display over HDMI.

The final system meets all the requirements set in the beginning of the project.
The goal of at least 30 FPS has been reached for several kernels,
at the target screen resolution of 512x256 pixels when running with 8 processor cores.

There is still room for further improvement of the computer, which will be detailed in the next section.

This project has been extremely challenging and demanding,
and has given the group as a whole great insight into the inner workings of computers,
and GPUs specifically.
