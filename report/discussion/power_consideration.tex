\section{Power Considerations}

The system is powered by a 5V mini USB connection that delivers 550mA \todo{picture of the cable spec? Or something similar. A listing of the cable's spec}
This gives a theoretic maximum power consumption of $550mA$ $*$ $5V$ $=$ $2.75W$

\todo{Add actual power consumption, either based on datasheets or physical measurements?}
\todo{software related power considerations? Sleeping MCU while kernel sleeps, awsm silicon labs stuff? In addition, perhaps some elaborations on energy use inside the GPU? Identifying energy critical systems.}
