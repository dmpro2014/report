\section{Programming Challenges}

There are several limitations and issues a programmer must have in mind when developing programs for the Demolicious system.
First of all, since no compiler for high-level languages is available, kernel code must be written in assembly.
The limitations of the language and relatively low expressiveness it provides,
makes kernels verbose and require substantial mental overhead.

The implementation of conditional execution, through predicated instructions only,
can also be quite difficult to get accustomed to.
Chaining multiple conditions together to form a correct logical structure,
can require sketching and some upfront planning of the program flow even for simple kernels.

These are, however, problems which are quite easily fixed by allowing compilation from a language with a higher abstraction level.
A tougher limitation is, although also one which can be handled by a compiler,
the limitations on the frequency of memory instructions.
Depending on the number of GPU cores,
memory instructions can't occur more than each X cycles.
Dealing with this, without the performance drop of executing nop instructions
is important when rendering live graphics.
