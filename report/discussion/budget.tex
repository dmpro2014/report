\section{Budget}

The group was given a budget of 10000 NOK for production of the PCB and component purchases. 
We had 10 boards manufactured at the price of 10103 NOK (see appendix \ref{fig:pcb-order} ) and ordered components at a price of 7571 NOK. (see appendix \ref{fig:component-order}) 
This made for a total cost of 17674 NOK.
The reason for going 76\% over the budget was twofold. Firstly, the PCB design took so much that time that, in addition to the size of the board, fast production and delivery from the manufacturer became necessary. 
This contributed greatly to the price.

Secondly, we bought enough components to solder at least 5 PCBs, which drove up the price a bit as well.
The total price could thus have been limited by a smaller, less backup oriented design. 
By allowing a longer production time for the manufacturer.
And finally, by not buying extra components.
