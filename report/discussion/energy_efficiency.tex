\section{Power Considerations}

The system is powered by a 5V mini USB connector that delivers 550mA \todo{picture of the cable spec? Or something similar. A listing of the cable's spec}
This gives a theoretic maximum power consumption of $550mA * 5V = 2.75W$

\subsection{Physical Implementation}

For a PCB to be as energy efficient as possible, there is a few things one can do.
The wires have to be as short as possible and the board as small as possible.
This will optimize for lowest possible static power consumption.

The backup oriented design of the PCB doesn't fit very well in with this.
All of the headers makes wires unnecessarily long and the big size makes the power planes extra large.
This makes the static power consumption higher than it could be.

However this is a conscious choice as there was only one chance for the PCB to work.

\todo{Add actual power consumption, either based on datasheets or physical measurements?}
\todo{software related power considerations? Sleeping MCU while kernel sleeps, awsm silicon labs stuff? In addition, perhaps some elaborations on energy use inside the GPU? Identifying energy critical systems.}
