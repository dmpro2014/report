\chapter{Discussion}

\section{Design process}
How did the final result come about
\subsection{PCB}
Split project schematics into several connected docs for the sake of modularity. Find some overarching hardware requirements and from there, related application notes and hardware considerations. Then some components and footprints that fit...ish with these docs.
Finally place components and route the wires between them digitally and order the PCB and components

\section{"Jaktstart"}

Not everyone can start at the same time

\section{Redundancy design choices or w/e}
What did we end up needing?
What could we have used, that we didn't think of.

\section{Does the computer make sense?}
Is the design sane?
Were we idiots?
Have we seen the light?

\section{Can we even saturate the memory bus?}
Do you even SRAM?
Or is memory the big bottleneck

\section{SRAM bottleneck}
HDMI vs. the GPU?
Will the HDMI be fine with always being second in line?
