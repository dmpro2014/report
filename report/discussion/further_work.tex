\section{Further work}

\subsection{Hardware}
The physical design of Demolicious worked as intended.
A second version will allow for a greater energy efficiency.
All headers and superfluous backup solutions can be removed, letting a new design focus on a small PCB with short wires and small power planes.
If a more powerful computer is to be made, a more powerful FPGA can be introduced along with a matching number of SRAMs.
Furthermore, power and data can be unified in a single USB connection.
The power USB and the FPGA are currently positioned far from one another, but in a new design they can be moved closer so that the 1.2V wire that powers the FPGA can be made as short as possible.
Lastly, it would have been convenient to have had flash memory for the FPGA as this would have let it have persistence.
