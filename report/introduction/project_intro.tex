\chapter{Computer Design Project}
\label{sec:intro}

This report presents the TDT4295 Computer Design Project at NTNU for the fall semester of 2014.

The project is the single task of a course every fall in which a group of students make a working computer from scratch.
This year's group was made out of 9 students from the Computer Science department.
Gunnar Tufte and Yaman UmuroÄŸlu, served as advisors for the group throughout the semester and assisted in administrative tasks.

\section{Assignment}

The Computer Design Project's primary tasks include making a custom printed circuitboard (PCB) and  implementing a custom processor architecture on an FPGA.
Together with a microcontroller (MCU) and a choice of I/O components, these will form a complete and working system.
The project is evaluated based on this report and an oral presentation of the work, as well as a prototype demonstration.

The task this year was to create a processor inspired by GPU architectures.
Core requirements included having multiple processor cores and a graphical display output.

	\subsubsection{Construct a graphics processing unit (GPU) inspired processor}
    \noindent GPUs play a large role in graphical applications as well as high performance computing.
    They are typically constructed around the SIMD (single instruction multiple data) paradigm and
    include special hardware for accelerating graphics-related operation. The idea is to make a
    GPU-inspired processor architecture that exploits the possibility of parallel computation on a
    single chip. The GPU must be a multi-core system.
    
    \subsubsection{Additional requirements}
    \noindent Your processor will be implemented on an FPGA, and you are free to choose how to
    realize your computer architecture. Studying the architecture of general multicore processors
    and parallel machines options can be a good starting point.\\
    
    \noindent Energy efficiency should be a primary consideration in all phases of the project, from early
    design decisions to how software is written.\\
    
    \noindent The task should also include a suitable application that can produce a graphical output on a
    display to demonstrate the processor.\\
    
    \noindent The unit must utilize a Silicon Labs EFM32 series microcontroller (to act as an I/O processor)
    and a Xilinx FPGA (to implement your architecture on). The budget is 10.000 NOK, which must
    cover components and PCB production. The unit design must adhere to the limits set by the
    course staff at any given time.

\section{A Parallel Processing Accelerator}

The group decided to make the custom GPU inspired processor as an accelerator processor for parallelizable computations.
This means that it would not be designed to run entire programs on its own, but would instead be tasked with particular parallelizable parts of a program.
Its purpose would primarily be to run graphics related operations.
However, it would be programmable with general arithmetic and logic operations, and not have specialized hardware units for performing graphics operations.
Graphics output would be sent to screen directly from the accelerator, like it is from a GPU.
This would form a graphical computer system similar to how modern PCs are organized.
