\chapter{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This report presents the assignment and solution to TDT4295 Computer Design Project at NTNU fall 2014.

The course is a single-task whole semester course in which each year a group of students
work together to make a working computer from scratch.
This year's group was made out of 9 students.

\section{Assignment}
The task given was to create a graphics processing unit (GPU) inspired processor.

\todo{Some more text here? Mention that we got to pick between multiple assignments?}

\subsection{Original Assignment Text}

The original assignment text\cite{assignment} is as follows:

\todo{Vi må kanskje ha med additional requirements også?}
\begin{quotation}
    GPUs play a large role in graphical applications as well as high performance computing. They
    are typically constructed around the SIMD (single instruction multiple data) paradigm and
    include special hardware for accelerating graphics-related operation. The idea is to make a
    GPU-inspired processor architecture that exploits the possibility of parallel computation on a
    single chip. The GPU must (as in option 1) be a multi-core system.
\end{quotation}

\section{Requirements}

Some requirements were given to us by our advisors, Gunnar Tufte and Yaman Umuroglu.
These included basic requirements for it to be a computer.
\todo{Fix this paragraph. We should probably list all the requirements}
The rest of the requirements were chosen by the group as a whole.
Firstly a list of desired features were listed, which were then prioritized.
See table \ref{tab:goals} for the list of desired features.
