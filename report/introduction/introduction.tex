\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:intro}

This report presents the assgnment and solution to TDT4295 Computer Design Project at NTNU fall 2014.

The course is a single-task whole semester course in which each year a group of students
work together to make a working computer from scratch.
This year's group was made out of 9 students.

\subsection{Assignment}
The task given was to create a graphics unit inspired processor.

\subsubsection{Original Assingment Text}

The original assignment text is as follows:

% TODO: vi må kanskje ha med additional requirements også?
\begin{quotation}
    GPUs play a large role in graphical applications as well as high performance computin. They
    are typically constructed around the SIMD (single instruction multiple data) paradigm and
    include special hardware for accelerating graphics-related operation. The idea is to make a
    GPU-inspired processor architecture that exploits the possibility of parallel computation on a
    single chip. The GPU must (as in option 1) be a multi-core system.
\end{quotation}

\subsection{Requirements}

Some functionallity was given to us by our advisors, Gunnar Tufte and Yaman Umuroglu.
These included basic requirements for it to be a computer.
The rest of the requirements were chosen by the group as a whole.
Firstly a list of desired features were listed, which was then prioritized.
See table \ref{tab:goals} for list of desired features.
