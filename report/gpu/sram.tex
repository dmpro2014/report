\subsection{SRAM Arbiter}

Connecting SRAM with the GPU, HDMI and CPU is a custom-built memory controller, the SRAM arbiter.
As multiple units may request access to SRAM at the same time, and the Demolicous system using an interlaced memory model,
dedicated access to SRAM cannot be guaranteed.
Therefore, a prioritization scheme is required.

The CPU has the highest read-write priority.
As the host program by convention shouldn't access memory when the GPU is executing kernels, this is fine.
The GPU comes in second, as it needs uninterrupted access to SRAM during execution.
If the HDMI unit could prevent the GPU from writing to memory,
the result of a kernel executions could differ based when the HDMI chooses to read the current framebuffer.
Therefore the HDMI unit has the lowest priority, having to scavenge pixels whenever it can.
