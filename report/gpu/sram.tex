\subsection{SRAM Arbiter}

The SRAM arbiter connects the LSU, HDMI unit and CPU to the SRAM.
As multiple units may request access to SRAM at the same time, and the Demolicous system is using an interlaced memory model,
dedicated access to SRAM cannot be guaranteed.
Therefore, a prioritization scheme is required.

The CPU has the highest read-write priority.
As the host program by convention shouldn't access memory when kernels are executing, this is fine.
The LSU comes in second, as it needs uninterrupted access to SRAM during execution.
If the HDMI unit could prevent the LSU from accessing memory,
the result of a kernel executions could differ based when the HDMI unit chooses to read the current framebuffer.
Therefore the HDMI unit has the lowest priority, having to scavenge pixels whenever it can.
