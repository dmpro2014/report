\section{HDMI}

The general HDMI specification consists of the Transition Minimized Differential Signaling (TMDS), and some additional wires for details regarding the transmitted signal[citation needed?].
However, we were able to produce a video feed on a screen from an FPGA using only the TMDS wires by cutting up an HDMI cable and using only those wires.
Upon seeing that this was feasible we decided to make the HDMI hardware with a TMDS connection only,going in to the FPGA. The resulting hardware was then an HDMI type-A receptacle footprint, the HDMI receptacle and a header between it and the FPGA.
The reason for adding the header was that this setup is equivalent to the aforementioned prototype version such that if the HDMI input wouldn't work we could connect the reterminated HDMI cable onto the header.
