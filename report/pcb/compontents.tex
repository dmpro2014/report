\section{Main Components}

\subsection{Microcontroller / System Control Unit}
The EFM32 Giant Gecko 32-bit Microcontroller from Energy Micro was chosen as the controller for this project.
A microcontroller from Energy Micro was required for the task and this particular controller is
very energy efficient, which is a plus.
In addition to this, there were a lot of development boards available,
plus over half of the group had experience with this controller from the subject
TDT4258 Energy Efficient Computer Systems.

The EFM32GG990F512-BGA112 was chosen as a powerful enough version of the microcontroller.

\subsection{FPGA}
The XC6SLX45-2CSG324I FPGA of the Spartan-6 family from Xilinx was chosen as the FPGA.
This particular FPGA has been used for different tasks on the university before, and the support systems are therefore available to us.
The version was the one used on the PCB.
A less powerful version of this one was available for testing on development boards in the lab.
