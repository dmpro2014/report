\section{Main Components}

\subsection*{MCU (EFM32GG990F512-BGA112)}
The EFM32 Giant Gecko Microcontroller from former Energy Micro, now Silicon Labs, was chosen as the microcontroller for this project.
One aspect of the task at hand is energy efficiency and this microcontroller is particular efficient in that manner.
This is a proven microcontroller with a lot of development boards available to us, so it seemed like a safe choice.

\subsection*{FPGA (XC6SLX45-2CSG324I)}
The  FPGA of the Spartan-6 family from Xilinx was chosen as the FPGA.
This particular FPGA has been used for different tasks on the university before, and the support systems are therefore available to us.
The version was the one used on the PCB.
A less powerful version of this one was available for testing on development boards in the lab.

\subsection*{SRAM}
Yes yes, very good SRAM \todo{More here}
