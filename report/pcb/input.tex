\section{Input}

The main method of communication between the microcontroller and a host PC is by USB.
The USB circuitry is designed with ESD protection in an effort to lessen the risk of frying the PCB.
Should the USB fail, a serial port (RS-232) has been implemented as a backup solution.
If this also fails, the wires from the serial port is put on headers, which can be used as GPIO pins.
If all else fails, the program to be run on the machine can be included when programming the MCU through the programming interface.
