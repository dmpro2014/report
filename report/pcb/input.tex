\section{Input}

The main source of data communication between microcontroller and a host PC is USB.
This protocol has been used for years on projects like these, with good results. \todo{citation needed}

However, if the usb fails, there are backup plans.
Primarily a serial port (RS-232) has been included to work if the USB should fail.
If this also fails, the wires from the serial port is put on headers, which can be used as GPIO pins.
