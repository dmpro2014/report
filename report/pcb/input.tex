\section{Input}

The main method of communication between the microcontroller and a host PC is by USB.
The USB circuitry is designed with ESD protection in an effort to lessen the risk of failure. 
However, if the usb fail, a serial port(RS-232) has been implemented as a backup solution.
If this also fails, the wires from the serial port is put on headers, which can be used as GPIO pins.
