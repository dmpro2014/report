\section{Output}
The main source of output from the FPGA is an HDMI connector.
This is a novel feature this year, as no previous group has tried to implement it before.

Because of this new challenge, a lot of backup schemes were put in place.
The HDMI connector is put on headers, in case the connector fails.
A separate VGA module is connected to the FPGA, in case the HDMI doesn't work and if this fails, a VGA module is also connected to the microcontroller.
