Step & components & Desription & Expected results & Actual result \\\hline
5V power & usb connector & Measure voltage on the header & Measure 5 volts on the incoming power line & \\
\hline
 & & & &\\
3.3V power & 3.3V header, 3.3V LDO, voltage regulator capacitors, power indicator LED and ARM programming header  & Solder the component and Messure the voltage on voltage-pin and observe teh D2 LED & Observe the power power indicator LED to light up and measure 3.3V form the powerline connected to the 3.3V net& \\
\hline
 & & & &\\
1.2V & 1.2V LDO, power indicator LED, voltage regulator capacitor, voltage regulator resistor. & Solder component and and messure the connector in BGA for 1.2V and observe the D1 LED & 1.2V on one connector in BGA, power indicator LED light up &\\
\hline
 & & & &\\
BGA & EFM32GG990, LX45 & place the component on a new PCB and bake them in the oven & Components dose not  fall of and all respectable pins are connected. &\\
 \hline
 & & & &\\
Electrical circiut & power supply, LDO voltage regulator, connected capacitor & Reconnect the electriical circuit on the new board & The FPGA and MCU gets the needed power. &\\
\hline
& & & &\\

Major components & HDMI, SRAM, Oscilliator, high and low frequency crystal, usb data & Solder the major components and connected header. & able to transfer the signal correctly & \\

\hline
& & & &\\
The Rest of the component & capacitor, resistor, LED, buttons,  & Solder the component  & A working PCB &\\
