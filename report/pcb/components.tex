\section{Main Components}

\subsection*{MCU (EFM32GG990F512-BGA112)}
The EFM32 Giant Gecko Microcontroller from former Energy Micro, now Silicon Labs, is chosen as the microcontroller for this project.
One aspect of the task at hand is energy efficiency and this microcontroller is particular efficient in that manner.
This is a proven microcontroller with a lot of development boards available to us, so it seemed like a safe choice.

\subsection*{FPGA (XC6SLX45-2CSG324I)}
The FPGA of the Spartan-6 family from Xilinx was chosen as the FPGA.
This particular FPGA has been used for different tasks on the university before, and the support systems are therefore available to us.
A less powerful version of this one was available for testing on development boards in the lab.

\subsection*{SRAM (AS7C38098A)}
The SRAM AS7C38098A was chosen as the memory storage for this project. 
The reasone that this particular SRAM was chosen, was that to be able to output graphical demos we would need to have frame buffers.\todo{Maybe explaine what a frame buffer is ?}
We would need a memory would need to be large enough to hold two frame buffers and a latency small enough to be able to switch between the two frame buffers fast ebough.
This specific SRAM meet the requirement.
This SRAM have a storage space at 512K words by 16 bit with a 10ns access time.
