\chapter{Physical Implementation}
\label{sec:pcb}

This chapter will describe the PCB layout, the main components and the design philosophy that went into solving the system requirements.

\section{Design for Redundancy}

When designing a system the PCB is one of the harder things to debug.
If a wire inside the PCB is wrong, there is not munch that can be done, except buying a new PCB.
This becomes apparant when seeing most projects only have a working PCB on the 3rd of maybe even the 4th try.
Because of this, a strong philosophy has been used in the design for the PCB, as shown in figure \ref{fig:pcb_philosophy}.

To make sure the propability that a pcb will have a working design will be as high as possible, all aspects of the PCB has one or more backup plans.
All important wires and unused pins have been put onto headers, which can be rerouted manually.
That way each part can be connected to other parts of the board, or to other sources.
Because of this, the board is not optimized for size, but was rather made to optimize for highest possible chance of success.

Another part of this design is that each vital part of the PCB follows a modular design.
Each isolated part will work on its own, with the help of other components, if the rest of the board fails.
A PCB with a broken MCU, but with a functioning FPGA can be connected together and work as one system none the wiser.

\section{Footprints}
Predominantly SMDs(surface mounted device) large enough for humans to solder(with a couple of exceptions)

\todo{...Uncertain ie om at vi endra litt p√• en del footprints, men pga hvordan fysiske komponenter funker,}

\subsubsection{Prebundled}

\subsubsection{Handmade}
Some footprints we had to make ourselves.
This was done inside Altium.
The specification for the footprints was found in the datasheets of the component in question.

When making the handmade footprints some other thoughts were taken into account.

\begin{itemize}
    \item We need to solder these components
    \item The connection on the components is physical, as long as it leads current, it will work.
    \item Some datasheets didn't match the component exactly, but was for a sister component
\end{itemize}

With this in mind we made footprints which was slightly bigger than it needed to.
