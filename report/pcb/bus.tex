\section{Bus}
The bus between the MCU and FPGA is an EBI connection.
EBI stands for External Bus Interface, which is a parallel adress/data bus connecting multiple external components like SRAM, MCU, GPU etc.
\TODO{More Info about the EBI?}
The EFM32GG990 has dedicated pins for the EBI, which can be found in the datasheet \cite{EFM32 Datasheet} to the MCU.
Headers are placed in between the MCU and FPGA in case of failure on either side of the connection, as well as an easy way to check transmitted signals during debugging.
