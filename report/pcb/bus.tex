\section{Bus}
The bus between the MCU and FPGA is a EBI connection.
EBI stands for Extrenal Bus Interface, which is a parallel adress/data bus connecting multiple external components like SRAM, MCU, GPU etc etc.
\TODO{More Info about the EBI?}
The EFM32GG990 have dedicated pins for the EBI, which can be found in the datasheet to the MCU.
Headers are placed in between the MCU and FPGA in case of failure on either side of the connection, as well as an easy way to check transmitted signals during debugging.
