\section{Clocks}
Both the MCU and the FPGA need an external clock.
According to the design consideration AN0002 \cite{efm32gg-design-consideration} the MCU needs two crystals, a low frequency crystal at 32.768kHz and a high frequency crystal at 48MHz.
For the FPGA, an oscillator of 120MHz was chosen.

Headers are placed between the oscillator and the FPGA. 
The headers serve as a backup in case an external oscillator is needed and act as a debugging tool.
The microcontroller clocks on the other hand have a backup solution in that the microcontroller has internal RC-oscillators for use in case the crystals malfunction.
