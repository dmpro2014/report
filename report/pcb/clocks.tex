\section{Clocks}
Both MCU and the FPGA needs a external clock.
According to the design consideration AN0002 (insert link)MCU need two crystals, a low frequency crystal at 32.768kHz and a high frequencey crystal at 48MHz. 
For the FPGA, a oscillator of 100MHz was choosen. The frequency of the oscillator depends on the requirement of the architecture.

Headers are placed between the oscillator and the FPGA. 
The headers serve as a backup in case an external oscillator is needed and serves as a debugging tool.
The microcontroller clocks on the other hand have a backup solution in that the microcontroller has internal RC-oscillators for use in case the crystals malfunction.
