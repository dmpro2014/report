\section{Clocks}
Both the MCU and the FPGA need a external clock. The MCU need two crystals, a low frequency clock at 32.768kHz and a high frequencey clock at 48MHz. 
FPGA oscillator along with header on which an external oscillator resource can be connected by way of backup.
The microcontroller clocks on the other hand have a backup solution in that the microcontroller has internal RC-oscillators for use in case the crystals malfunction.
